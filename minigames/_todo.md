# todo (minigames)

for mix master - the odd color (with no match) still might be moving at the time of win.... 
   and when its done moving... depending on where it lands, either the gradient goes away or is revealed....

### Checklist
re-enter EACH completed minigame - ensure state is reset...

## TODOS

just saying, I like uxInstance->print_here and all, but we could have snprintf'd this once at boot time....
 sa  // once at boot....
