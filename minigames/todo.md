# todo (minigames)

Game Timer State - THIS IS STRANGE as its ok if it updates, but if the game won't start moving again, it becomes pointless to update.....
   ^ so it keeps rendering (everything) (once per INTERVAL) even though the time will never change.
   ^ calling ceaseUpdatingTime() fixes it.... 
   // how to enforce!!!!!
